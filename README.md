# AI-Powered Maze Solver: Heuristic Search & Visualization

This project is a comprehensive simulation of AI-based pathfinding algorithms on a dynamically generated 2D maze environment. It leverages various heuristic functions to evaluate and compare the performance of the A* algorithm alongside a classical uninformed search strategy (Flood Fill). Visualization is integrated using Matplotlib for intuitive understanding of search behaviors.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Dynamic Maze Generation**: Procedurally generates randomized mazes with configurable dimensions.
- **A* Search Algorithm**: Implements A* with multiple heuristic functions:
  - Manhattan Distance
  - Euclidean Distance
  - Diagonal Distance
  - Chebyshev Distance
- **Flood Fill Algorithm**: Included as a baseline uninformed search method.
- **Heuristic Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Number of node comparisons
  - Total path length
  - Execution time
- **Visual Representation**: Real-time visualization of search paths, obstacles, and search areas using `matplotlib`.

## üß† Technical Concepts & AI Alignment

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Demonstrates core AI search strategies including informed (A*) and uninformed (Flood Fill) search.
- **Heuristics**: Utilizes admissible and consistent heuristic functions for A* to guide search more efficiently.
- **Pathfinding**: A foundational problem in robotics, game AI, and autonomous agents.
- **Algorithmic Analysis**: Tracks and compares computational cost and effectiveness of each approach.

**üß™ How It Works**

Generate a random maze (create_maze()).

Run each search algorithm:

a_star(heuristic=manhattan_distance)

a_star(heuristic=euclidean_distance)

a_star(heuristic=diagonal_distance)

a_star(heuristic=chebyshev_distance)

flood_fill()

Visualize and benchmark:

Display search path

Print number of movements, comparisons, and runtime

**‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Execution**

Run the main script:

python maze_solver.py

Output includes:

Maze grid visualization

Search path in green

Start and destination highlighted

Performance metrics printed in console

**üìä Performance Metrics**

Each algorithm run provides:

Total path length (movement steps)

Search comparisons (visited nodes)

Execution time (in seconds)

**üìå Future Enhancements**

Support for diagonal movement in flood fill

Weighted grid support (Dijkstra variant)

Interactive UI (Tkinter or Web-based)

Real-time step-by-step animation
